Project Overview
I solved a business problem for a simulated company AtliQ Motors looking to enter the Indian Electric Vehicle market. I performed a complete analysis of the market and focussed on solving the problem and giving solutions rather than just reporting the given data in the dataset. 


Source of data : 
1. Codebasics resume challenge dataset
2. Vahansewa dashboard (added additional information)

Data Extraction - Google Sheets 
Data extracted through google sheets from all sources and then loaded in Power BI

Data Transformation - Power Query
performed data modelling in Power Query. 
i) Created star table schema by creating relations between tables through the time dimension. 
ii) Used DAX formulas for time intelligence and created calculated measures. 

Loaded the data in Power BI 
Created an interactive dashboard representing the present and past sales KPIs of Indian EV market. Also added data about the future scope of EVs and AtliQ Motors in India.
